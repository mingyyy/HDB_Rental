### Purpose of the project
Singapore government is dedicated to making Singapore the futuristic city country, a modern example of the world.
They have been improving the transparency and the quality of public information. From [Singapore government's one-stop portal to its publicly-available datasets](https://data.gov.sg), we could find high quality data related to different aspects of Singapore which is useful for not only researchers but ordinary Singaporean. 

I am particularly interesed in property market in Singapore and trying to find out more about the trends and characters in the market. 

### Source of Data
The data of the self-declared median rent published by HDB per town per quarter from 2015 to 2019 was obtained through an API call , with the following [endpoint](https://data.gov.sg/api/action/datastore_search). 

The total number of records at the moment (last updated: November 8, 2019, 16:24 (SGT)) is 18186. However, only 8372 records have valid rental information.

### Analysis
Starting from a few hypotheses, I have done the following to gain insight into those interesting aspects of the property market. 
1. Property in prime locations holds better value during challenging periods?
2. TBC
